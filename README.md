# ImageStreamer

This project demonstrates how to implement image streaming using various popular Python web frameworks: Flask, FastAPI, and Tornado. It allows you to efficiently transmit and display images over HTTP, which can be useful in applications such as video streaming, real-time image processing, and more.

## Features

- Efficient streaming of images over HTTP.
- Support for multiple web frameworks: Flask, FastAPI, and Tornado.
- Demonstrates different approaches to image streaming using each framework.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code examples.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Flask, FastAPI, and Tornado frameworks.
- OpenCV for image manipulation.
- Ultralytics for computer vision feature - extra hand
